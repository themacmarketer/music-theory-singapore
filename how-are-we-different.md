# HOW ARE YOUR MUSIC LESSONS UNIQUE OR DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER MUSIC SCHOOLS?

We understand that no two people (let alone musicians!) are identical in the way they learn or in terms of physique.

This has an impact on how each individual masters music theory and acquires the technical skill required to make music on their instrument.

That is why each lesson taught by Shao-wen is planned according to the requirements of the individual learner.

He will provide you with the essential ingredients to develop a great technique and teach you how to harness your new musical skills to become an engaging performer, anchored by a deep musical understanding.

Rest assured that we focus on providing everything you need to make your learning experience as enriching and fulfilling as possible.
