# Why learn with us?

WE UNDERSTAND THAT NO TWO PEOPLE (LET ALONE MUSICIANS!) ARE IDENTICAL IN THE WAY THEY LEARN OR IN TERMS OF PHYSIQUE.
This has an impact on how each individual acquires the technical skill required to make music on the violin.

That is why each lesson taught by Shao-wen is planned according to the requirements of the individual learner.

He will provide you with the essential ingredients to develop a great violin technique and teach you how to harness your new musical skills to become an engaging performer, anchored by a deep musical understanding.

We take a comprehensive approach to the study of music and offer both violin lessons and music theory lessons. You can even customise your learning experience to include both in your one-hour session.

Give our theory lessons a try and let us convince you that theory is not as dry or boring as they make it out to be.

You might even end up concluding that it is - dare we say it? - AWESOME.
